Implementation:
        - To the best of our knowledge and from all of our testing, we believe
                that our programs have been correctly implemented

Architecture: 
        In order to modularize our program and enhance the compression and 
        decompression process, we created multiple modules. To note, we have a 
        structs.h file that contains the structs we use throughout our program. 
        We were able to modularize our compression program such that each 
        conversion operation, their inverse, and the required helper functions 
        were grouped into separate files. We implemented an RGB to Component 
        Video conversion module. Similarly, we implemented a component video to 
        discrete cosine and chroma value conversion module. In order to
        separate the functions that were responsible for the quantization and 
        dequantization process, we created a quantize module. In order to 
        account for packing and unpacking codewords which contained the 
        bitpacking module, we created a pack module. In this project we 
        attempted to keep each module independent to the best of our ability. 
Hours Spent:
        - Analyzing: 20
        - Solving: 25
        
Encountered Problems: 
Throughout this project, we ran into some errors in regard to bitpacking. We 
were confused on how to properly create a mask that would allow is to update 
a specific region within a signed integer. In addition, a big problem we 
encountered throughout this project was how we made sure each module was 
relatively independent.
